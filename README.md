# Your Project Title Here

My project is an interactive poster about the issues and harassment women face in our society. 

## Summary

I designed a poster featuring items women commonly have in their purses. For every object, there is a hot spot the viewer can press which plays a recorded story or statistic about that specific item, aimed to bring awareness about certain issues women encounter and the defense mechanisms they have developed in turn. The sound is played through earphones for a more personal experience. The challenges I encountered were choosing which items and stories would be most impactful, while trying to figure out how to trigger sound through capacitive touch.


## Component Parts

- Poster (made with Adobe Illustrator)
- Zoom recorder
- Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board
- Wires
- Copper tape, aluminum foil, and coins
- Earphones
- Battery pack

The input is human touch/pressure and power. The output is audio. The data stored is the audio files.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge for me was trying to figuring out how to trigger sound with touch. I originally tried to use code for it, but I couldn't figure out how to make it completely work, nor could I upload it onto the Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board I was using for sound. Thus, I decided to make the triggering based on physical contact. I wrapped the two ends of the wires (GND and PIN#) in copper tape, aluminum foil, and coins for conductivity. One end was mounted on the poster side, and the other was on the hard backing behind, so when the viewer pressed down on a certain spot of poster, the force would cause the two sides to touch and trigger the sound.
